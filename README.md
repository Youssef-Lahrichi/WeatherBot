# WeatherBot

This discord bot utilizes Open Weather Map's free API to retrieve current weather data in a city.

Commands:
!weather
!temp
!forecast
!sunrise
!sunset

Note: All of the above commands take a city name, but work without one. If one is not provided, then the bot assumes the user entered "Seattle".
